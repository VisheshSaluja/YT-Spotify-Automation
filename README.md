# Automating transfer of songs from YT music to Spotify
This project allows the user to connect their YouTube music and spotify acounts. Then using the verification key from YT it allows 
access to all the playlists that are made on that particular YT account.
You choose the playlist you want to transfer and all the songs are added to your Spotify playlist.

For Youtube authentication there is a credential file which contains the API ID and Key
